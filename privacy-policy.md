# 🔒 Privacy Policy for Sally
This policy was last edited at 17/07/24 (DD/MM/YY).

This document has the purpose to serve as a Privacy Policy for Sally (collectively referred to as “Sally”, “Sally's Owner” in this Privacy Policy). This document states how your data is handled and stored.

## 📚 How we store and use your data

Your data is stored on a MongoDB Atlas Cloud. All data stored is **public information** available to anyone. The data stored includes, but is not limtied to: your Discord ID, your Roblox username, avatar, description and other publicy available data that any user is able to fetch using Roblox's API.

The data Sally stores is solely used to fulfill its own purpose, providing a verification system and doing in-game checks. These in-game checks are done with a private API Sally provides, which require authorization and no data is exposed if the user making the request does not provide a valid authorization header.

Sally **will never** store passwords, real names or any other private information you did not give your consent for. Sally will always store the same information, that was previously mentioned, for all users.

## 🗑️ Data Deletion and Review
The user has the right to **delete their data whenever they want**. Sally offers its own methods, by providing a simple `Delete Data` button when using the `/verify` command. Sally also deletes the user data **automatically** when a user leaves the main server used for verification (WePeak). When leaving the main server it is assumed you will not use our service again (as it is private for that specific server).

The user has the right to request data deletion, and/or request to see what's being stored to Sally's owner. Sally's owner should fulfill this request as soon as possible. The **only way to make these requests** are through Discord private messages directly with Sally's owner (dark.py).

If you have any other questions about how your data is stored and/or handled or wish to make some request, please contact `dark.py` via Discord.
